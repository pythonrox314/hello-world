What's up?

My name is Ithamar and I am so excited to be FINALLY committing to web coding and development full time! I have been interested in computers since birth, and only wanted a career in this field. But life gets in the way sometimes, and you have to live it on its terms.

But now, after raising kids, and a couple of divorces, I am now in a position where I can just sit back and follow my passion, which is coding. Just getting started, but look out, I will be a factor soon.
